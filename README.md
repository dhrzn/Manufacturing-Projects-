# Manufacturing Experience
- This repository documents my hands-on manufacturing and CAD experience from **MAE 272 – Introduction to Manufacturing Processes** at California State University, Long Beach.
- The content focuses on foundational manufacturing methods, technical drawing interpretation, and practical shop experience through completed projects, photographs, and videos.

## Course Context
- MAE 272 introduces core manufacturing processes including machining, forming, casting, joining, additive manufacturing, and metrology. The course emphasizes understanding how material properties, process parameters, and tooling affect manufacturability and product quality

## Skills and Topics Demonstrated
- CAD modeling and technical drawing interpretation
- Machining and basic metalworking processes
- Welding fundamentals
- Additive manufacturing (3D printing)
- Measurement and metrology techniques
- Manufacturing safety and process awareness
- Documentation of engineering work

## Disclaimer
- All work shown in this repository was completed as part of an academic course and reflects student level manufacturing experience under supervision.
